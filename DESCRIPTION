Description: Provides an implementation of finite mixture regression models for censored
    data under four distributional families: Normal (FM-NCR), Student-t (FM-TCR),
    Skew-Normal (FM-SNCR), and Skew-t (FM-STCR). The package enables flexible
    modeling of skewness and heavy tails often observed in real-world data, while
    explicitly accounting for censoring. Functions are included for parameter
    estimation via the EM algorithm, computation of standard errors, and model
    comparison criteria such as AIC, BIC, and EDC.
